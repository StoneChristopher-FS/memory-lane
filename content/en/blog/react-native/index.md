This week I have been learning a lot about React Native and so far I am really enjoying it. I really like the ease of developing for multiple different platforms as it really cuts down on work load and is something I have been wanting to learn so I can start developing my own cross platform apps. Although getting used to the way CSS is done it is nice to see that it has a similar struture to React making it a bit easier to pick up and use. I look forward to trying to build some side projects in React Native when I get some free time.
