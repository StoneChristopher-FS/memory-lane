After watching the video this week on how to deploy a static API to Heroku, I wanted to do a little testing on how to set it up on Netlify as well since that has been the main service I have been using. I have not found any good articles that explained similar to what the class videos showed so I had to dive into the Netlify site and sort of figure things out myself. I believe I found all the locations within the site settings to allow access to all IP addresses and setup environment variables so that I can connect my MongoDB to the service. Hopefully there will not be many hiccups when trying to use Netlify but if there are there seems to be enough documentation to find out what I am doing wrong.
